Many members of my family are deeply involved in the computer science field, and their passion for coding and technology has always inspired me.
Growing up around them, I’ve seen firsthand the dedication and expertise they bring to their work, whether it’s developing complex software or solving intricate programming problems. 
Their knowledge and skills in coding, which are quite advanced, have been a constant source of motivation for me to follow in their footsteps.
